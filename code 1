Hamilton would make himself known as a key leader of the newly founded Federalist party using his influence to attack the presidency of John Adams, a fellow Federalist. After John Adam's defeat in the election of 1800, Hamilton would remain neutral during the contingency election following between Democratic-Republicans, Jefferson, and Burr. During Jefferson's administration, Hamilton vocally attacked the president and his philosophy. With the 1804 election fastly approaching Hamilton easily won the party's nomination and will now face off against his ideological opponent in a battle that will determine what country America will be.","color_hex":"#f0c862","secondary_color_hex":null,"is_active":1,"image_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/John_Trumbull_-_Alexander_Hamilton_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg/823px-John_Trumbull_-_Alexander_Hamilton_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg","electoral_victory_message":"<h3>REAL PATRIOT DUMMY EXAMPLE SWEEPS</h3>","electoral_loss_message":"<h3>Fake News?</h3>","no_electoral_majority_message":"<h3>DUMMY EXAMPLE RETURNS TO HELL</h3>","description_as_running_mate":null,"candidate_score":1,"running_mate":false,"scrollable":false}},{"model":"campaign_trail.candidate","pk":1002,"fields":{"first_name":"Thomas","last_name":"Jefferson","election":13,"party":"Democratic-Republican","state":"Virginia","priority":1,"description":"<b>NOT PLAYABLE</b><br><br>Is there a man more well-known in our new republic than Thomas Jefferson?
